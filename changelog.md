## 1.1.0 - 7/20/21
- Added new commands:
    - 'toggleblock' - either holds block or releases block
    - 'togglesprint' - holds down circle so any movement is a sprint in movement direction.
        - cancelled either by typing 'togglesprint' again or by typing 'o'/'circle'
- Lowered delay between commands from 0.2 seconds to 0.1 seconds
- Fixed minor bug where unintended command is pressed since first letter of last word was considered a command attempt
